### Notes & Recall

<details>
  <summary>Notes</summary>

- Self closing tags - br
- Use emmet
- Meta tags are used for SEO
  - Html title is shown in the google search result
  - meta "description" is used as a summary for shown result
- There should be only one h1 tag
- Block and Inline level (Important Concept)
  - Block occupies whole space, whereas  inline captures the space inline
  - Block level has a custom style by default. For eg. margin etc
- HTML entities
  - Search w3school for more
  - eg. '&nbsp' for space
- HTML semantics - header, footer, nav, main, section, ariticle, aside.
- HTML reads line by line
- Submitting a form
  - Query string is the string appended to the URL which is received by the server. This string is in the form of key value pairs tied together with ANDs.
  - Default method of form attributes : GET, POST, PUT etc.
  - Query string is normally constructed for GET request
  - POST you have to check the content of the mesasge.
- URL understand ? and & but for some characters it replaces it with special strings for example @ â†’ %40
- `<div>` : is used to make division in your html file. Divide up our content. Div allows us to have style. It allows us to logically divide our html into various sections.
- **`<span>`**: is an inline element where in we can apply css styles.
- `<p>` - /r/n , assigns a new block on the page
- normal text is just appended one behind another
- Using `<b> </b>` or `<strong> </strong>`
- Use `<em>.. </em>`
- By default most server return index.html. it is a common practice
- When we refer an page or image relative to our html file. just by giving the path in the src or href. Then we are referring to relative address
- But, when we try to access a resource using file, http or https, we are referring to a absolute resource.
